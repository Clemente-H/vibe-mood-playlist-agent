## The Idea

Spotify DJ is... meh. It always plays the same rotation, doesn't understand your current vibe, and feels robotic.

**Mood Vibe Curator** is an intelligent agent with a beautiful visual interface that lets you:
- Select colors that represent how you feel
- Describe your mood with words
- Get perfect music automatically added to your Spotify queue

Simple, beautiful, and actually gets you.

- Text input for describing emotions
